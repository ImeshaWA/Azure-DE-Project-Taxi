# Azure End-to-End Data Engineering Project

This project demonstrates a complete data engineering pipeline built on **Microsoft Azure** using the **NYC Taxi dataset**. It follows the **medallion architecture** (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers) and leverages key Azure services like **Data Factory**, **Databricks**, and **Data Lake Gen2** with **PySpark** and **Delta Lake** for data processing and storage.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Azure Data Factory** – Ingest data from API to Data Lake
- **Azure Data Lake Gen2** – Store raw, cleaned and curated data
- **Azure Databricks** – Transform data using PySpark
- **Delta Lake** – ACID-compliant data storage
- **Parquet Format** – Efficient columnar storage format
- **Medallion Architecture** – Bronze (raw), Silver (cleaned), Gold (curated)
